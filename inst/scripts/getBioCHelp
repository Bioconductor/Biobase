GetBioC is a function that gets the required Bioconductor libraries
from correct web sites and install them to the R library on a local machine.
The function takes the following arguements:
    
libName: a character string for the name of the Bioconductor library to be
installed. Current valid names include "all" - all the released packages;
"affy" - package "affy" plus packages included in "exprs";
"CDNA" - package "CDNA" plus packages included in "exprs"; and "exprs"
- packages "Biobase", "annotate", "genefilter", "geneploter", "edd",
"Roc", and "tkWidgets". 

destdir: a character string for the directory on a local machine where
the downloaded packages will be stored.

isDevel: a boolean indicating whether the released (FALSE) or
developer (TRUE) version of the packages will be downloaded and installed.

verbose: a boolean indicating whether any error related to the
downloading process will be (TRUE) printed out on the screen. Error
messages will still be returned but invisible if verbose is set to
FALSE.

Source getBioC.R on a local machine and run the function with proper
arguements will allow for obtaining and installing all the required
packages for a Bioconductor library.
